# dotfiles
My Linux configuration files

Pretty self-explanatory

Here's a small description of each file:

-i3config - i3-gaps window manager config.

-i3status.conf - i3status bar config.

-Xdefaults - urxvt terminal emulator config.

-mpd.conf - mpd music player config.

-newsboatconf - newsboat RSS reader config.

-urls - newsboat RSS urls.  I use it to subscribe to YouTube channels.

-userChrome.css - Changes Firefox appearence to make it look more minimalistic. I don't use it anymore though.


-----scripts-----

-colorchanger.sh - changes urxvt color palette.

-init.sh - creates necessary folders and files for all the dotfiles to work. Only needs to be run after a fresh install.

-update.sh - updates all the dotfiles so you can manage them all from one folder.
